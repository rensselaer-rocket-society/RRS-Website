          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>The Rensselaer Rocket Society, hereafter referred to as RRS or the club, has the primary purpose of designing, building, and flying high-powered rockets. All projects and activities for RRS must satisfy one, if not several, of the main five (5) goals of the club as defined below, and then must pass the RRS Project Feasibility Survey. The one necessary requirement for all projects is that they must have promised active participation from at least twenty percent (20%) of the club population. This will be measured by compiling a list of signatures of members who are dedicated to work on the project, and then comparing that to the list of dues paying members for that semester. 
             The 5 goals are as follows:
          </p> 
         <ul>
            <li>Assist in the completion of high-powered certifications for individual members.</li>
            <li>Competing in multi-level national competitions, including, but not limited to, BOTR, NSL, and IREC.</li>
            <li>Design, test and build subsystems and payloads to achieve specific goals for rockets, either for competitions
                or club decided projects outside of a competitive setting.</li>
            <li>Foster community outreach with the local Rensselaer and Troy community.</li>
            <li>Any project not listed in the four (4) categories above but has the aforementioned promised active participation 
                from at least twenty percent (20%) of the club population, 
                and satisfies the primary purpose of designing, building and flying rockets.</li>
         </ul>
